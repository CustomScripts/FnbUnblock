**Update:** FNB has [reversed the decision][1] to block password managers, which means this Chrome extension is now redundant. It has been unpublished from the Chrome web store.

# FnbUnblock

FNB blocks password managers and saved passwords. This small extensions removes this block and allows you to use a password manager or saved password to log into your FNB account.

## Usage:

Just install the extension, and you will be able to log into FNB online banking using your saved password.

## Disclaimer

This extension just creates a new hidden field on the page which FNB uses to check if you have typed your password or not. This extension will never do anything else with any data available on the FNB website other than ensuring that a password manager can be used for your login details.
